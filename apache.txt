# Only perform redirect if entry found in RedirectMap

RewriteCond "${APIRedirects:$1|NOT_FOUND}" !NOT_FOUND
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ "${APIRedirects:$1}" [R,L]

The captured URL (as $1) is put through the RewriteCond. If the
LookupKey is found, the redirect occurs. If the LookupKey is not
found, the RewriteRule is skipped.
